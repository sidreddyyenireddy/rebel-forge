# Development, testing, and deployment tools

This directory contains a collection of tools for running Continuous Integration (CI) tests, 
conda installation, and other development tools not directly related to the coding process.

### Continuous Integration

You should test your code, but do not feel compelled to use these specific programs. You also may not need Unix and 
Windows testing if you only plan to deploy on specific platforms. These are just to help you get started

* `travis-ci`: Linux and OSX based testing through [Travis-CI](https://about.travis-ci.com/) 
  * `before_install.sh`: Pip/Miniconda installation script for Travis
